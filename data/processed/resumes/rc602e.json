Proficient in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\nand SRUM AGILE methodologies of development process to produce software solutions by team. Involved in designing, planning, developing\nand implementing Microsoft .Net based solutions that meet quality and code standards using C#, ASP.Net, ASP.Net MVC JavaScript, jQuery,\nCSS, Bootstrap CSS, HTML, XML and AJAX. Strong experience in data retrieval and manipulation using ADO.Net data objects such as\nDataset, Data Reader, Data list, Data Adaptor, Entity Frame work. Good experience in writing Class Library using C# , LINQ to SQL queries in\nDatabase Access layer to interface with SQL Database. Worked extensively with .Net Server Controls, Web User Controls, Data Grid, Web\nControl, Form Validation Controls and created Custom controls. Worked on creating and modifying Table Definitions, stored procedures in SQL\nDatabase. Modified and written web services using C# to interact with the other applications so data can be served. Used Red Gate SQL\nCompare to deploy database from one server to another server (Dev -> Test/QA).Worked on .NET security features such as Form-Based\nAuthentication and Role-Based Authorization. Used various ASP.Net client side and server validation Controls, used JavaScript for client side\nvalidations. Involved in bug fixes and production support. Worked closely with Scrum Master for backlog catalogs, feature catalogs and prioritized\nthe tasks Participated in daily scrums and weekly meetings with the project sponsors to meet expectations and deadlines Interact with QA to\nensure the defects are properly cleared to attain the quality standards Providing demos to the QA team at the end of the sprint to push for its final\nstage. Worked with cross-functional teams to meet project.\nHighlights\nC#, \nJava, VB.Net, C, C++\n,.Net Technologies: \n.Net Framework 4.0/4.5, ASP.Net, ASP.NET MVC, VB.Net, ADO.Net, Entity Framework, AJAX, Web Service,\nLINQ, \nEntity Framework, LINQ queries. ASP.Net, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS.\nIDE: \nVisual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, Dreamweaver\nDatabase: \nSQL, MySql\nOperating System: \nWindows\nVersion Controls : \nTortoise SVN, GitHub\nOthers: \nMicrosoft Word, Excel, Access, Power point\nExperience\nDatabase Programmer/Analyst (.NET Developer)\n \nJun 2014\n \nto \nFeb 2016\n \nCompany Name\n \n\u00ef\u00bc\u200b \nCity\n \n, \nState\nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nWorked as Graduate Research Assistant performing the duties of Database Programmer/Analyst at Application Development Network (ADN),\nDoIT which supports University of Missouri System faculty and students through agile and rapid creation of new applications.\nProjects:\n \u00c2 \nAtlas: \n\u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThis project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.\nA tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor\nsubmits availability. A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. Also, there are some set of rules for\ndropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task\nwhich runs every day.\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nCreated a Availability Calendar Grid. In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. Clicking on the cell toggles the\navailability. Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order\nto get that data)\nDeveloped C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.\nGot rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. Created Class libraries out of the main project to\naccess the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.\nIntegrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.\nUsed jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.\nUsed role based authorization for various pages.\nOccupational Therapy:\n \u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThe goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies. Adding functionalities to upload pdf files.\nResponsilities:\n\nCreated separate Login page for Administrator and Students. Used Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students.\nDeveloped a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students.\nUpdated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages.\nModified the structure of database to login.\nUsed Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever.\nReplaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies.\nAppInventory: \n\u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nThe goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their\ndeveloped, ongoing and future projects. For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group,\nUser Departments etc. and each application has different version. For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database,\nplatforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc. Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application\n(Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients. After starting the project\nthey can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.\nResponsibilities:\n \u00c2 \nEntity Framework was used using Database first approach.\nLINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database\nConsumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.\nConsole Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.\nAutomatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.\nUsed client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.\nWorked on agile environment.\nParticipated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.\nGoAdmin:\n \u00c2 \nDescription:\n \u00c2 \nGoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to provide services to all possible users of the university.
