Proficient with MS Windows, MS Office, Minitab, Business Objects, Adobe CS3\nWeb Edition, Visual Studio, Frontpage, PaintShop Pro.\nExperience\nInformation Technology Coordinator\n \nNov 2003\n \nto \nCurrent\n \nCompany Name\n \nProvide technical support throughout the office from building and managing the web presence, networking computers and other\noffice equipment as well as researching grant opportunities for the implementation of a technology component for the Leadership SOAR program.\nResponsible for building capacity for the foundation within the area of information technology by helping them move closer to a paperless\nenvironment. The scope of my role is to streamline IT operations, implement an effective online marketing and media strategy, automate the work\nprocesses for employees, and centralize the activities of GivingBack Foundation, Inc. by using the internet and other media.\nWeb Developer\n \nJun 2003\n \nto \nCurrent\n \nCompany Name\n \nAs webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System\nDevelopment Life Cycle. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed\ndesign specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems\nusing Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux\nHosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key\nASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software.\nClients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.\nIntranet Application Support Analyst\n \nJan 2003\n \nto \nJul 2007\n \nCompany Name\n \nKey responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private\nlabel and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that\nparameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers\nthat arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful\nimplementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives\nsuch as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface\nand make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during\npeak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT\nteams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i\ninfrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production\nenvironment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the\nsystem to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%\ncompliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and\napproval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within\nthe scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run\nteam was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing\nmaintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow\nfor a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management\nLeadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which\nI filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus\non and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague.\nImplemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure\nof the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to\n7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be\ncompleted within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10\n- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of\nknowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain\nbusiness functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.\nEducation\nBachelor's\n \n, \nComputer Information Systems\n \nDeVry University\n \n\u00ef\u00bc\u200b \nCity\n \n, \nState\n \n, \nUS\n \n9/2000 - 6/2004 DeVry University, Alpharetta, Georgia\nBachelor's Degree, Computer Information Systems Academic Honors: Dean's List, Hope Scholarship GPA 3.46 while working and attending\nschool full-time\nAffiliations\nGivingBack Foundation, Inc\nCertifications\nSix Sigma Green Belt Certified\nSkills\n\nMarketing, Operations, Database, Asp, Ms Sql Server, Sql, Sql Server, Technical Support, Testing, Asp.net, Budget, Clients, Database Systems,\nLife Cycle, Linux, Ms Asp, Ms Sql Server 2000, Mysql, Online Solutions, Php, Project Launch, Solutions, Sql Server 2000, System\nDevelopment, Closer, Media Strategy, Networking, Online Marketing, Bank Card, Collections, Credit, Data Migration, Receivables, Intranet,\nMaintenance, Application Support, Archiving, Data Management, Subject Matter Expert, Work Flow, Business Requirements, Engineer, Finance,\nGraphical User Interface, Increase, Kronos, Load Balancing, Offshore, Oracle, Payroll, Production Environment, User Interface, Belt Certified,\nBlack Belt, Six Sigma, Six-sigma, .net, Associate, Client/server, Coding, Css, Customer Service, Database Management, Detail Oriented, Dhtml,\nFlash, Frontpage, Html, Javascript, Microsoft Sql Server, Microsoft Sql Server 2000, Minitab, Ms Office, Photoshop, Project Management,\nReceptionist, Retail Sales, Self Motivated, Software Development, Structured Software, Team Player, Test Plans, Time & Attendance, Time And\nAttendance, Visual Studio, Xml",
